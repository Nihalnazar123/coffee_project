            <h2>Coffee</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering
                plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw
                product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a
                consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in
                hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>

            <h2>Orgin Of Coffee</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in modern day Ethiopia, however
                neither
                where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have
                been found.
                Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread
                to the Levant and
                Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and
                Mamluk society. Coffee arrived
                in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while
                Central and Eastern Europeans
                learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies.

            <h2>Production Of Coffee</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Many of these countries maintain substantial supply-chain relations with the world's largest coffeehouse
                chains
                and enterprises. These coffeehouses play a prominent role in supporting developing economies by waging a
                variety of coffee wars to gain market share.
                Often these coffeehouse chains pay a premium above market price in order to alleviate fair trade and
                sustainable farming concerns.
                Developing countries that participate in the coffee market wield considerate influence on global coffee
                economics.</p>

                <p>Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling

                    be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees.</p>
